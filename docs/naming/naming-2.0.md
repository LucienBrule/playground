## Renaming

As it stands now, Playground is a project that is in the process of being
renamed.

The name Playground was chosen because it was a kotlin project that was meant to
be a playground.
The codebase is now mature enough to be named something else.

## Features

The software is a web application that multiplexes a single browser window into
multiple windows, while also providing a way to share the windows with other
users and to control the share window with collaborative cursor and keyboard
input.

# Naming

## Specifications

The name must be:

- Memorable
- Short
- Easy to pronounce
- Easy to spell
- Easy to type

The name must not be:

- A trademark
- The name of a programming language
- The name of an existing project
- Playground
