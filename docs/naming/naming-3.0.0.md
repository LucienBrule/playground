## Idea Generation Matrix

The following table is a matrix of made up names and their corresponding
meanings.

Scores range from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best.
A score of zero denotes that the name is not allowed, and a score of 10 denotes
that the name is perfect.

Each Name has a reason for its score, which is listed in the Reason column.

Good names have high scores and bad names have low scores.

Trendy names with pop culture references are preferred over common names.

Each score must be an integer and may only be between `0` and `10`.
Not every name will have the same score and the best names will have the best scores.

Not every name will have a score of 10, but the best names will have a score of 10.

Each successive name should be completely different from the previous name in
spelling, meaning, and context, to include the first letter of each name which must be unique.

Ensure the Meaning of each name is varied from other meanings.
